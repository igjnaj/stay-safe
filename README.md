# How to Stay Safe / Not Get RATs
## 1. Decompile and Check the Code
Use tools to decompile and check the file.
## 2. STOP. TRUSTING. RAT. CHECKERS.
Most RAT checkers are garbage (e.g., isthisarat.com).
## 3. STOP. DOWNLOADING. CRACKED. SOFTWARE.
Please, for the love of god, STOP DOWNLOADING CRACKED SOFTWARE. I repeat, STOP DOWNLOADING CRACKED SOFTWARE! You don't know what's inside it.
## 4. OPEN SOURCE DOESN'T MEAN IT'S SAFE.
Most software you use may have open-source versions, but it doesn't mean it's safe (phobos accident).
## 5. Don't Trust Your Friend.
Stop trusting your friends. Don't download their weird, sketchy software. The people you call "friends" can betray you at any time they want.
## 6. Run Files in a VM to Check
You can try running the cracked/sketchy software you think is a RAT in an [undetectable virtual machine](https://youtu.be/koWipFDgD6c?si=Ec4CBsDqyybJh_da).

This is from my **experience**. Stay cool and stay safe.
